Liquid densities
================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting densities for 61 organic liquids, each system consisting of
about 1000 atoms. The dataset covers aliphatic, aromatic molecules, as well as different
functional groups and halogenated molecules.

Metrics
-------

1. Density error

For each system, the density is calculated by taking the average density of an NPT molecular
dynamics run. The initial part of the simulation, here 500 ps, is omitted from the density
calculation. This is compared to the reference density, obtained from experiment.

Computational cost
------------------

Very high: tests are likely to take several days to run on GPU.

Water ethanol density curves
============================

Summary
-------

Benchmark of the density of water-ethanol mixtures for different concentrations of ethanol, compare to experiment.
1 ns of NPT MD on about 120 water/ethanol molecules for 6 concentrations.


Metrics
-------

1. rms of the density difference.
2. rms of the excess volume difference.
3. Concentration of the minimal excess volume.


For each system, the density is calculated by taking the average density of an NPT molecular
dynamics run. The initial part of the simulation, here 500 ps, is omitted from the density
calculation. This is compared to the reference density, obtained from experiment.
The excess volume is computed as the difference between the actual molar volume of the mixture and the ideal molar volume obtained by linear combination of the pure-component molar volumes.
The concentration of the minimal excess volume is estimated by fitting a quadratic to the three grid points surrounding the minimum and taking the vertex of the parabola.

Computational cost

Very high: tests are likely to take several days to run on GPU.
