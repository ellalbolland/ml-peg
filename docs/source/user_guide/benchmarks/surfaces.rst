OC157
=====

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting relative energies between three configurations for 157
molecule-surface combinations.

Metrics
-------

1. Energy error

How accurate all relatve energy predictions are.

For each group of three structures, the relative energies are calculated for all pairs
of structures. Models receive a score based on the mean difference between these
predictions and the reference, averaged over all pairs and over all combinations.

2. Ranking error

Whether the most and least stable strucutres are predicted.

For each group of three structures, the relative energies are calculated for all pairs
of structures. Models receive a score of 0, 0.5, or 1, based on whether the predicted
lowest and highest energy pairs match the reference predictions, and this is averaged
for all 157 combinations.

Cleavage Energy
===============

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting cleavage energies for 36,718 surface configurations
across a wide range of materials and Miller indices.

Metrics
-------

1. Cleavage energy MAE

Accuracy of cleavage energy predictions compared to DFT reference values.

For each surface, the cleavage energy is calculated as
``(E_slab - thickness_ratio * E_bulk) / (2 * A)``, where ``E_slab`` and
``E_bulk`` are single-point energies of the slab and the lattice-matched bulk
unit cell, ``thickness_ratio`` is the number of bulk unit cells in the slab
thickness, and ``A`` is the surface area. Results are reported in meV/A^2.
The mean absolute error is computed over all 36,718 surfaces.

2. Cleavage energy RMSE

Root mean squared error of cleavage energy predictions across all surfaces.

Computational cost
------------------

Medium: benchmark involves only single-point calculations, but for 36,718 slab-bulk pairs. Takes roughly 5-20 minutes on GPU or a few hours on CPUs.

Data availability
-----------------

Input data:

* Surface configurations were obtained from the Materials Project, covering
  3,699 unique bulk materials with multiple Miller indices and terminations
  per material. The original unfiltered data source is available at
  Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10381505).
