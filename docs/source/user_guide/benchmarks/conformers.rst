Summary
-------

Performance in predicting relative conformer energies of 12 C12H26,
16 C16H34 and 20 C20H42 conformers. Reference data from PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12/ AVQZ calculations.

Metrics
-------

1. Conformer energy error

For each complex, the the relative energy is calculated by taking the difference in energy
between the given conformer and the reference (zero-energy) conformer. This is
compared to the reference conformer energy, calculated in the same way.

Computational cost
------------------

Low: tests are likely to take minutes to run on CPU.

Folmsbee
========

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting relative conformer energies for a set of drug-like
molecules. Each molecule has a small set of conformers (3-10 per molecule)
whose energies are ranked relative to the lowest-energy conformer. Reference
data from DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations.

Metrics
-------

For each molecule, the relative energy of every conformer is taken with respect
to the lowest-energy reference conformer (set to zero). The predicted energies
are aligned to the same reference conformer and converted to kcal/mol before
being compared against the :math:`DLPNO-CCSD(T)` reference.

1. MAE

The mean absolute error between predicted and reference relative energies,
averaged over all molecules.

2. Conformer Score

For each molecule, the per-molecule MAE and RMSE are passed
through a soft threshold (MAE at 0.5 kcal/mol, RMSE at 1.5 kcal/mol) to give a
value between 0 and 1, and these are averaged across all molecules. Molecules
for which the model fails to produce an energy profile score 0.

Computational cost
------------------

Medium: Minutes on GPU. Minutes to tens of minutes on CPU.

TorsionNet500CCSDT
===================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting torsional energy profiles for 500 diverse organic
molecular fragments. Reference data from DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.

Metrics
-------

1. RMSE of relative torsional energy profile
2. MAE of relative torsional energy profile

For each fragment, a torsion scan samples the energy at a series of dihedral
angles. Both the reference and predicted energies are mean-centered per scan,
so only the shape of the profile is compared rather than absolute energy
offsets. RMSE and MAE are calculated between the reference and predicted
profiles for each scan, then averaged across all 500 fragments.

Computational cost
------------------

Medium: tests are likely to take minutes to run on GPU, or less than an hour on
CPU for each model, since each fragment requires a single-point energy
calculation across ~20 conformers in its torsion scan, repeated for all 500
fragments.
